# An Leabharlann Írusáin

## About
Welcome to **An Leabharlann Írusáin**, a comprehensive library of Celtic, Gaelic, and Brytthonic source texts. Currently that consists of a long markdown file filled with links to various places around the internet where these resources are stored. The name of this library is an homage to [@turbarius](https://x.com/turbarius) on Twitter, whose indefatigable and precise citations inspired in many of us a dedication to primary sources (and because the name sounds nice).

The scope of this project will be to collect links and references to all known works of Celtic history, and also to collect significant works written *by* the Celtic peoples on any topic.

New links will appear over time, and this project may take an entirely new structure as we progress. Help is wanted in documenting our national histories.


## Contributing

If you have a link or a text you'd like to contribute, either contact [@ogmios](https://x.com/ogmios) or [@GaelicRevival](https://x.com/GaelicRevival), or create a pull request on this repository. I will review and PRs shortly after they're made, and include any valid entries. Feel free to download any media to the *leabharlann* folder, but try to keep it small.
